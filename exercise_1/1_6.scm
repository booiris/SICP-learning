;Exercise 1.6
;Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided as a special form. ``Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?'' she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

; Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)

; 5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)

; 0

;Delighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))

; What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

; 由于 normal-order 的原因，传入 new-if 的参数需要被计算一遍，导致 sqer-iter 重复迭代于同一个输入，递归爆栈。
